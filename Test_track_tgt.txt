The show has a dedicated test track called the "Eboladrome", at the former RAF Wroughton. Clarkson states in the first episode that the name is due to its shape resembling the structure of the Ebola virus.

It is designed to "trip cars up," according to Clarkson. Section names include the "Isn't Straight", "Your Name Here", "Old Lady's House", "Substation" and "Field of Sheep". In the first episode, the track was said to have been modified following the discovery of an unexploded Second World War bomb.

Cars are tested by NASCAR driver Mike Skinner, known as "The American". According to the presenters, the hiring of Skinner was a contractual obligation by Amazon.com, and that Skinner considers anything not American, front-engine and V-8 powered as "communist". While doing a lap, Skinner makes sarcastic remarks about the car and the presenters.

Prior to the first episode the Lap board had been pre-populated with ten times from a selection of cars, and the laps themselves were not shown, just the timings. The first car to be shown being driven by Skinner, with an on-screen lap time, was a 2016 BMW M2 recording a time of 1:26.2 seconds. The track is also used for general filming and testing by The Grand Tour, meaning that other vehicles—such as a Ferrari 488 used in episode one—may appear on the track, but are not timed either.
